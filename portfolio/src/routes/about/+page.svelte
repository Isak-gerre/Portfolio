					`Hello! Iâ€™m a web developer with a strong passion for creating functional, user-friendly applications. My expertise lies in Next.js, TypeScript, and Material-UI, and I also have hands-on experience with AWS and SST. I enjoy working on projects where I can merge problem-solving with clean, user-focused design to deliver impactful solutions.`,
					`Currently, Iâ€™m a developer at IFSEK, contributing to Solkoll, a platform that helps solar panel installers ensure high-quality installations for their customers. This project has been especially rewarding as it combines my technical skills with a mission to support a more sustainable future. My role spans front-end development, UI/UX design, and even some back-end work, which keeps each day both engaging and challenging.`,
					`I thrive on digging into the details and finding the best solutions to complex problems. Whether itâ€™s debugging a tricky issue, optimizing a process, or brainstorming innovative features, I enjoy the variety that comes with development. Seeing a project come to life and knowing it creates value for users is what drives me.`,
					`Outside of work, I love spending time with my daughter, dancing and competing in bugg. Iâ€™m also passionate about exploring new hobbies, gaming, enjoying great movies, and diving into music. Staying curious and maintaining a balanced life helps me bring fresh energy and perspective to everything I do.`

					`Outside of coding, I have a variety of hobbies that fuel my creativity and help me stay balanced. One of my long-standing passions is dancing and competing in bugg, a Swedish dance style that is full of energy and precision. Itâ€™s a dynamic, fast-paced dance that requires focus, coordination, and a sense of rhythm, and I love the challenge of mastering new moves and competing with others who share the same passion. Itâ€™s a fun way to stay active while connecting with people outside of the tech world.`,
					`I also have a growing interest in flying FPV drones, which is my newest hobby. Thereâ€™s something incredibly exciting about the combination of piloting and filming, and Iâ€™m still learning the ins and outs of the craft. The freedom of flying through the air and capturing unique perspectives is both exhilarating and challenging. Iâ€™m excited to continue improving my skills, exploring new locations, and sharing my experiences through the lens of these high-tech drones.`,
					`In addition to these activities, Iâ€™m also enjoy making rugs with a tufting gun, a creative and hands-on process that allows me to design intricate patterns and bring them to life with yarn. Itâ€™s a satisfying mix of artistry and craftsmanship, and I love how tangible the outcome is. Each rug is a piece of art that I can be proud of, and itâ€™s an excellent way for me to unwind while still engaging my creative side.`,
					`I also enjoy dabbling in 3D modeling, which is another way for me to express my creativity and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Whether Iâ€™m modeling something for fun or learning new techniques, this hobby gives me a chance to experiment and think outside the box. I often find that the problem-solving skills I develop through 3D modeling overlap with my work as a developer, so itâ€™s both a hobby and a way to enhance my professional skills.`,
					`Each of these hobbies allows me to tap into different creative outlets and keeps me energized and inspired. They provide a balance to my work and help me maintain a fresh perspective in everything I do.`

					`Dancing in kitchens where fun canâ€™t subside,`,
					`Hunting for hobbies that give my heart wings,`,
					`These are a few of my favorite things.`,
					`When the chores call,`,
					`When the mood falls,`,
					`When Iâ€™m feeling sad,`,
